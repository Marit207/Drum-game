# Drum-game

This is my first game I completely made myself in Pygame. After I made a runner game with a Youtube video I wanted to make a game myself.
In my free time I make a lot of music. I play euphonium in brassbands, and I play several other musical instruments.

I also have a passion for programming. I wanted to combine these two in a game. Also because I learn the most by making a project.

It was a challenge to make, but it was a lot fun. These are one of the things I learned from this project:
How to use timers.  
How to play sounds in a game.  
How difficult it is to find the right order of the code, and if I change 1 things everything stops working.  
How to work with the program Photopea.
